Whether you‚Äôre coding solo or working in a team, one thing becomes obvious fast: style inconsistencies and formatting nitpicks waste time.

Over the years, I‚Äôve landed on a setup that saves mental overhead, keeps the codebase clean and scales well across teams and projects. In this guide, I‚Äôll walk you through how I configure Prettier, ESLint with Airbnb‚Äôs style guide, Stylelint, Husky and lint-staged in a Node.js environment.

Let‚Äôs start with a high-level view of what each tool brings to the table.

## **üì¶ Overview: What Each Tool Does (and Why You Need It)**

| **Tool** | **What It Solves** |
| --- | --- |
| [**Prettier**](https://prettier.io/docs/) | Automatically formats code to a consistent style across file types. |
| [**ESLint**](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/) | Detects syntax errors and enforces coding best practices in JS/TS code. |
| [**Airbnb Config**](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) | A widely-adopted ESLint config that enforces readable, consistent JS code. |
| [**Stylelint**](https://stylelint.io/) | Linter for CSS/SCSS that catches errors and enforces style conventions. |
| [**lint-staged**](https://github.com/lint-staged/lint-staged#readme) | Ensures linters only run on staged files ‚Äî fast and targeted. |
| [**Husky**](https://typicode.github.io/husky/) | Hooks into Git to run checks before code is committed ‚Äî keeping your main branch clean. |

When combined, these tools reduce the surface area for bugs, reduce friction in code reviews and let you focus on solving real problems ‚Äî not arguing about trailing commas.

## **üßπ Step 1: Prettier ‚Äî Your Formatting Backbone**

Prettier is an opinionated formatter. It doesn‚Äôt care how you want your code to look ‚Äî it enforces a consistent, readable style. It supports many file types: .html, .json, .js, .ts, .css, .scss, .md, etc.

### **üîß Install**

```bash
npm install --save-dev prettier
```

Create a `.prettierrc` file at the root of your project. You can modify these settings as per your preferences. Check [Prettier](https://prettier.io/docs/) docs for all available options. Here's a sample configuration I use:

```json
{
  "bracketSpacing": true,
  "printWidth": 120,
  "singleQuote": true,
  "tabWidth": 2,
  "trailingComma": "all"
}
```

**Why these settings?**

* `bracketSpacing` - Improves readability with space inside object literals: `{ key: value }`.
    
* `printWidth` - I find 80 too cramped; 120 gives more breathing room, especially for modern monitors.
    
* `singleQuote` - JavaScript traditionally uses single quotes; this reduces diff noise and aligns with many style guides.
    
* `tabWidth` - Standard size, especially in JS/TS communities.
    
* `trailingComma` - Makes diffs cleaner and reduces bugs when adding new lines.
    

Create a `.prettierignore` file at the root of your project to exclude files/directories you don‚Äôt want Prettier to touch ‚Äî generated files, IDE configs, etc.

```plaintext
node_modules
build
dist
coverage
.vscode
```

## **üß† Step 2: ESLint + Airbnb ‚Äî Code Quality & Best Practices**

Where Prettier handles style, ESLint enforces logic and structure. It catches things like unused variables, accidental globals and subtle syntax issues.

The Airbnb style guide is battle-tested and opinionated. It promotes clarity, consistency and best practices out of the box.

### **üîß Install dependencies**

```bash
npm install --save-dev eslint eslint-plugin-node eslint-config-node
npm install --save -dev eslint-plugin-prettier eslint-config-prettier
npx install-peerdeps --dev eslint-config-airbnb-base
```

> Note: Use `eslint-config-airbnb` instead of `airbnb-base` if you‚Äôre working with React.

Create an `.eslintrc.json` file at the root of your project. Here's a sample configuration which uses the Airbnb base rules (which exclude React-specific rules). It also adds Prettier and node config as a rule. Checkout [ESLint](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/) docs for full sets of available rules:

```json
{
  "env": {
    "browser": true,
    "commonjs": true,
    "es2021": true
  },
  "extends": ["airbnb-base", "prettier", "plugin:node/recommended"],
  "plugins": ["prettier"],
  "rules": {
    "prettier/prettier": "warn",
    "no-console": "warn",
    "no-unused-vars": "warn",
    "no-shadow": "off",
    "no-underscore-dangle": "off"
  }
}
```

**Key rules explained:**

* `prettier/prettier` - ESLint surfaces Prettier issues, but only as warnings.
    
* `no-console` - Logs are useful during development but shouldn‚Äôt ship to prod.
    
* `no-unused-vars` - Helps avoid bloated, misleading code.
    
* `no-underscore-dangle` - I often use \_id from MongoDB, so this rule gets turned off.
    

## **üé® Step 3: Stylelint ‚Äî Keep Your Stylesheets Clean**

Stylelint works just like ESLint, but for styles. It ensures your SCSS/CSS is consistent, avoids deprecated syntax and promotes clean layout logic.

### **üîß Install**

```bash
npm install --save-dev sass stylelint stylelint-config-standard-scss stylelint-config-prettier
```

Create `.stylelintrc.json` in project root. Here's a sample configuration:

```json
{
  "extends": ["stylelint-config-standard-scss", "stylelint-config-prettier"],
  "rules": {
    "color-function-notation": "legacy",
    "selector-class-pattern": null
  }
}
```

**What this does:**

* `standard-scss` gives us a solid base config for SCSS.
    
* `tylelint-config-prettier` disables rules that conflict with Prettier.
    
* We relax strict class naming rules `selector-class-pattern` to suit different naming conventions (BEM, utility-first, etc.).
    

## **‚ö° Step 4: lint-staged ‚Äî Lint Only What Changed**

Without lint-staged, Husky would run ESLint/Prettier on the whole codebase for every commit. That‚Äôs slow and unnecessary. lint-staged is a package that can be used to run formatting and linting commands on staged files in a Git repo.

### **üîß Install**

```bash
npm install --save-dev lint-staged
```

lint-staged will run specific commands on staged files before committing them. Add the following configuration to your `package.json`. The below configures lint-staged to run Prettier, Stylelint and ESLint. Only add the Stylelint script for front-end projects:

```json
"lint-staged": {
  "*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}": ["prettier --write", "eslint"],
  "*.{css,scss,json,md}": ["prettier --write", "stylelint --allow-empty-input"]
}
```

> This setup makes sure only staged files are linted/formatted, keeping pre-commit hooks fast and focused.

## **üîê Step 5: Husky ‚Äî Git Gatekeeper**

[Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/) allows us to run scripts at key Git lifecycle moments. Here, we‚Äôll use it to run lint-staged before any commit. Thus code only ever gets into the repo after it has been consistently formatted and verified to be free of linting errors. This a particularly big advantage in a team setting.

### **üîß Install and set up**

```bash
npm install --save-dev husky
npx husky init
```

The `init` command simplifies setting up Husky in a project. It creates a `pre-commit` script in `.husky/` and updates the `prepare` script in `package.json`. Modifications can be made later to suit your workflow.

Update the `.husky/pre-commit` file:

```bash
npx lint-staged
```

> This ensures your staged files pass all checks before being committed.

Create `.husky/install.mjs` file:

```javascript
// Skip Husky install in production and CI
if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' || process.env.CI === 'true') {
    process.exit(0);
}

const husky = (await import('husky')).default;
console.log(husky());
```

> This ensures husky is only installed in dev environment.

## üõ†Ô∏è Step 6: Helpful NPM Scripts

Add these to your `package.json` for manual use or CI pipelines, adjust according to your project setup:

```json
"scripts": {
  "lint": "eslint './**/*.@(js|jsx|ts|tsx)'",
  "lint:fix": "eslint './**/*.@(js|jsx|ts|tsx)' --fix",
  "prettier:check": "prettier --check './**/*.{js,ts,json,md,css,scss}'",
  "prettier:write": "prettier --write './**/*.{js,ts,json,md,css,scss}'",
  "style:check": "stylelint '**/*.{css,scss}' --allow-empty-input",
  "prepare": "node .husky/install.mjs"
}
```

* `lint` - This script will run ESLint on all JavaScript, TypeScript, JSX and TSX files in your project.
    
* `lint:fix` - This will do the same as the lint script but will also attempt to automatically fix any issues that ESLint can handle.
    
* `prettier:write` - This script will format all JS, JSX, TS, TSX, JSON, CSS, SCSS and Markdown files using Prettier. This ensures consistency in both code and documentation.
    
* `prettier:check` - This will check if all the specified files adhere to the formatting rules specified by Prettier. This is especially useful as a pre-commit or CI/CD step to ensure that no non-formatted files get committed or deployed.
    
* `style:check` - This will check if all the specified CSS, SCSS files adhere to the formatting rules specified by Stylelint. Only add for front-end projects.
    
* `prepare` - This will only run Husky in non-production environment.
    

You can, adjust the patterns like `./**/*.@(js|jsx|ts|tsx|json|css|scss|md)` to fit the specific needs of your project and which directories or file types you want to include/exclude.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Using in your Workflow

Whenever you're about to commit, you can run:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Set up linting and formatting"
# lint-staged script will run every time you commit
```

> This will ensure that your code is both linted and formatted. If anything had not been set up correctly, you would likely get errors during commit.

## üß© Bonus: VS Code Setup for Auto-Formatting

To make all of this seamless, configure VS Code to format on save and use the following extensions:

* [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)
    
* [Stylelint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=stylelint.vscode-stylelint)
    
* [Prettier - Code formatter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)
    

Put the following in `.vscode/settings.json` in the project (you can of also put these settings in you User Preferences file):

```json
{
    "[javascript]": {
        "editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode"
    },
    "typescript.tsdk": "node_modules/typescript/lib",
    "[typescript]": {
        "editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode"
    },
    "[javascriptreact]": {
        "editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode"
    },
    "[typescriptreact]": {
        "editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode"
    },
    "[scss]": {
        "editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode"
    },
    "scss.lint.emptyRules": "ignore",
    "stylelint.validate": ["css", "scss"],
    "editor.formatOnSave": true
}
```

> The above set up, will allow the extensions to lint and format on Save.

## ‚úÖ Final Thoughts

This setup may feel like a lot up front ‚Äî but once it‚Äôs in place, it quietly handles all the repetitive formatting, catches subtle issues and keeps your Git history clean.

It‚Äôs not about obsessing over code style. It‚Äôs about freeing up mental bandwidth so you can focus on solving real problems, not arguing over trailing commas or indentation.

## **ü§î What Do You Use?**

I‚Äôd love to hear how others approach this:

* What‚Äôs your go-to setup?
    
* Any must-disable rules in your projects?
    
* Do you skip this entirely for small experiments?
    

Let me know your take. Always curious to hear how other devs keep their code clean.
